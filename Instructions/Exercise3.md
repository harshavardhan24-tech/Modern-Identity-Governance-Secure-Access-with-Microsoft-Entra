# Exercise 3: Microsoft Entra Verified ID

**Estimated Duration: 60 minutes**

## Overview

In this exercise, you set up Verified ID, registered a DID, and verified your domain. You created and issued a credential and stored it in the Authenticator app. You then verified the credential through a sample application. Finally, you explored a help desk scenario to understand how Verified ID enables secure, passwordless identity verification.

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Issuer** | An organization that creates and issues verifiable credentials to users |
| **Holder** | The user who receives and stores credentials in their digital wallet (Microsoft Authenticator) |
| **Verifier** | An organization or application that requests and verifies credentials from the holder |
| **DID (Decentralized Identifier)** | A globally unique identifier anchored to a blockchain or DID registry |
| **Verifiable Credential (VC)** | A tamper-evident credential containing claims about the holder, signed by the issuer |

## Task 3: Verify Credentials in Sample Application (Help Desk Scenario)

In this task, you will simulate a real-world help desk identity verification scenario using Microsoft Entra Verified ID. Instead of traditional methods like passwords or security questions, the user will present a verified credential to securely prove their identity.

### Task 3.1: Deploy sample verification application

1. Now navigate back to Microsoft Entra admin center. click on **Organization setting** under Verified ID and copy the **DID Authority** and paste it in the notepad.

   ![](./Images/ETS3201.png)

   ![](./Images/ETS3206.png)

### Task 3.2: Configure Verification Request with Required Claims

1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Verified ID** > **Overview**.

2. Review the **Verifier configuration** — the verification request specifies:
   - Which credential type to request
   - Which claims to extract from the presented credential
   - The purpose/reason for the verification

3. In the sample verification application, look for a **Settings** or **Configuration** page.

4. Verify that the application is configured to request:
   - **Credential type**: `VerifiedEmployee`
   - **Accepted issuers**: Your tenant's DID (e.g., `did:web:contoso.com`)
   - **Required claims**: `displayName`, `jobTitle`

   ![Verification configuration](Images/ex3-task3-verification-config.png)

### Task 3.3: Present Credential from Authenticator to Verify Identity

1. On the verification application page, click **Verify My Identity** or **Verify Employee Credential**.

2. A QR code will be displayed on screen (or a deep link if accessing on mobile).

   ![Verification QR code](Images/ex3-task3-verification-qr.png)

3. On your smartphone with Microsoft Authenticator:
   
   a. Open the **Microsoft Authenticator** app
   
   b. Navigate to the **Verified ID** or **Credentials** section
   
   c. Tap on the **Verified Employee** credential
   
   d. Tap **Present** or use the scan function to scan the QR code
   
   e. The app will display what claims will be shared and with whom

4. Review the presentation request:
   - **Requestor**: The verification application (help desk)
   - **Claims requested**: Display name, job title
   - **Purpose**: Identity verification for help desk

5. Tap **Share** to present the credential.

### Task 3.4: Review Verification Results and Extracted Claims

1. After presenting the credential, return to the browser showing the verification application.

2. The verification result page should display:
   - **Verification status**: Verified
   - **Credential type**: VerifiedEmployee
   - **Issuer DID**: Your Verified ID issuer DID
   - **Extracted claims** such as:
     - Display Name
     - Given Name
     - Surname
     - Email Address
   - **Credential validity**: Valid (within expiry date)
   - **Credential revocation status**: VALID

   The page also displays additional verifiable credential details such as:
   - Subject DID
   - Credential ID (jti)
   - Issuance date
   - Expiration date
   - Domain validation details
     
   ![Verification result](Images/ex3-task3-verification-result.png)

3. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Verified ID** > **Overview** section, scroll down to see the **Activity log**.

4. Review the Verification activity to see the recent verification event logged.

### Task 3.5: Review Verification Logs in Microsoft Entra

1. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **Monitoring & health** > **Audit logs**.

2. Apply the following filers:
   - **Service**: Verified ID 
   - **Date range**: Last 24 hours

3. Review the audit log entries for:
   - Credential issuance events
   - Credential verification events

4. Click on a log entry to see detailed information including:
   - The request ID
   - The verifier application
   - The credential type presented
   - Whether verification was successful

### Step 6: Understanding Real-World Help Desk Use Cases

Consider a scenario where an employee contacts the IT help desk requesting access to a sensitive internal application or requesting an account unlock.

Traditionally, the help desk agent might verify the employee’s identity using security questions, employee IDs, or manual checks against HR records. These methods can be time-consuming and may still be vulnerable to impersonation or social engineering attacks.

With Microsoft Entra Verified ID, the employee can securely present a Verified Employee credential from Microsoft Authenticator. The help desk application verifies the credential and validates claims such as the employee’s name and job title before granting access or processing the request.

In this exercise, the verification application simulated the help desk system, while Microsoft Authenticator was used to securely present the employee credential.

The help desk scenario demonstrates several key benefits of Verified ID:

| Traditional Help Desk | With Verified ID |
|----------------------|------------------|
| User answers security questions (easily guessed) | User presents cryptographically signed credential |
| Help desk manually looks up user in HR system | Claims are automatically extracted from the credential |
| Identity verification can take 5-10 minutes | Verification happens in seconds |
| No audit trail of how identity was verified | Full audit trail of every credential presentation |
| Vulnerable to social engineering attacks | Resistant to social engineering — credential cannot be forged |

Observe how:
- The credential was verified cryptographically
- Claims were securely shared from Microsoft Authenticator
- Identity verification was completed within seconds
- Verification activity was recorded for auditing purposes

**Additional Use Cases for Verified ID:**

1. **Partner/Vendor Onboarding**: Third-party companies can issue credentials to their employees, which your organization can verify without directly relying on the partner’s identity provider.

2. **Age Verification**: Verify that a user meets an age requirement without collecting unnecessary personal information.

3. **Professional Certification**: Validate professional certifications issued by trusted organizations.

4. **Alumni Access**: Universities can issue digital credentials to graduates for verification by employers or other institutions.

5. **High-Value Transaction Authorization**: Require employees to present a Verified ID credential before approving sensitive or high-value transactions.
   
## Summary

In this exercise, you configured Microsoft Entra Verified ID by setting up the issuer, registering a decentralized identifier (DID), and verifying domain ownership. You created and issued a verified credential, stored it in the Authenticator app, and successfully used it for identity verification. Finally, you simulated a help desk scenario to understand how Verified ID can replace traditional authentication methods with a more secure and user-friendly approach.

## Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab.
