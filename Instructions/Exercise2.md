# Exercise 2: Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access (Internet & Private Access)

**Estimated Duration: 60 minutes**

## Overview
In this lab, you will configure Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access to securely manage access to private and internet resources. You will enable the service, install the client, and set up Private Access to connect to internal resources without a VPN. You will apply Conditional Access policies to enforce security controls and configure Internet Access for web filtering. Finally, you will validate connectivity and review logs to ensure policies are working as expected.

## Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites to complete this exercise which are already configured in this lab environment:

- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license
- **Microsoft Entra Internet Access** and **Microsoft Entra Private Access** licenses (included in Microsoft Entra Suite)
- Global Administrator or Security Administrator role
- A Windows 10/11 device that is either **Microsoft Entra joined** or **Microsoft Entra hybrid joined**
- For Private Access: An on-premises server or Azure VM to act as the Private Access connector host
- Internet connectivity from the connector server to Microsoft Entra

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Task 1: Enable Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access
- Task 2: Configure Entra Private Access
- Task 3: Apply Conditional Access Policies to Private Access
- Task 4: Configure Entra Internet Access
- Task 5: Validate Access and Review Logs

## Task 1: Enable Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access

Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access is Microsoft's Security Service Edge (SSE) solution that combines identity-aware network security with Zero Trust network access. It provides two core capabilities:

- **Microsoft Entra Private Access**: Replaces traditional VPN by providing Zero Trust access to private/on-premises resources
- **Microsoft Entra Internet Access**: Provides Secure Web Gateway (SWG) capabilities for internet-bound traffic.

In this task, you will activate Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access in your tenant and prepare the environment for secure access to both private and internet resources. You will also download the Global Secure Access client, which will be used in later tasks to connect endpoint devices securely

1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Global Secure Access (1)** then select **Dashboard (2)** and click on **Activate (3)**.

## Task 2: Configure Entra Private Access

In this task, you will configure Microsoft Entra Private Access by enabling traffic forwarding and deploying a Private Access connector. You will create an application segment and assign users to securely access internal resources. Finally, you will validate connectivity by accessing a private resource (RDP) through the Global Secure Access client without using a traditional VPN.
