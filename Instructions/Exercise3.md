# Exercise 3: Microsoft Entra Verified ID

**Estimated Duration: 60 minutes**

## Overview

In this exercise, you set up Verified ID, registered a DID, and verified your domain. You created and issued a credential and stored it in the Authenticator app. You then verified the credential through a sample application. Finally, you explored a help desk scenario to understand how Verified ID enables secure, passwordless identity verification.

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Issuer** | An organization that creates and issues verifiable credentials to users |
| **Holder** | The user who receives and stores credentials in their digital wallet (Microsoft Authenticator) |
| **Verifier** | An organization or application that requests and verifies credentials from the holder |
| **DID (Decentralized Identifier)** | A globally unique identifier anchored to a blockchain or DID registry |
| **Verifiable Credential (VC)** | A tamper-evident credential containing claims about the holder, signed by the issuer |

### Task 3.6: Understanding Real-World Help Desk Use Cases

Consider a scenario where an employee contacts the IT help desk requesting access to a sensitive internal application or requesting an account unlock.

Traditionally, the help desk agent might verify the employee’s identity using security questions, employee IDs, or manual checks against HR records. These methods can be time-consuming and may still be vulnerable to impersonation or social engineering attacks.

With Microsoft Entra Verified ID, the employee can securely present a Verified Employee credential from Microsoft Authenticator. The help desk application verifies the credential and validates claims such as the employee’s name and job title before granting access or processing the request.

In this exercise, the verification application simulated the help desk system, while Microsoft Authenticator was used to securely present the employee credential.

The help desk scenario demonstrates several key benefits of Verified ID:

| Traditional Help Desk | With Verified ID |
|----------------------|------------------|
| User answers security questions (easily guessed) | User presents cryptographically signed credential |
| Help desk manually looks up user in HR system | Claims are automatically extracted from the credential |
| Identity verification can take 5-10 minutes | Verification happens in seconds |
| No audit trail of how identity was verified | Full audit trail of every credential presentation |
| Vulnerable to social engineering attacks | Resistant to social engineering — credential cannot be forged |

Observe how:
- The credential was verified cryptographically
- Claims were securely shared from Microsoft Authenticator
- Identity verification was completed within seconds
- Verification activity was recorded for auditing purposes

**Additional Use Cases for Verified ID:**

1. **Partner/Vendor Onboarding**: Third-party companies can issue credentials to their employees, which your organization can verify without directly relying on the partner’s identity provider.

2. **Age Verification**: Verify that a user meets an age requirement without collecting unnecessary personal information.

3. **Professional Certification**: Validate professional certifications issued by trusted organizations.

4. **Alumni Access**: Universities can issue digital credentials to graduates for verification by employers or other institutions.

5. **High-Value Transaction Authorization**: Require employees to present a Verified ID credential before approving sensitive or high-value transactions.
   
## Summary

In this exercise, you configured Microsoft Entra Verified ID by setting up the issuer, registering a decentralized identifier (DID), and verifying domain ownership. You created and issued a verified credential, stored it in the Authenticator app, and successfully used it for identity verification. Finally, you simulated a help desk scenario to understand how Verified ID can replace traditional authentication methods with a more secure and user-friendly approach.

## Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab.
