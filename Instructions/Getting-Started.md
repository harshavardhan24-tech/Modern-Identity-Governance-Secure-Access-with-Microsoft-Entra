# Modern Identity Governance & Secure Access with Microsoft Entra

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Lab Scenario

You are part of the **Cloud Identity team** at **Contoso**, a growing organization that is facing challenges with **manual user onboarding and offboarding**, **excessive or outdated access permissions**, reliance on **traditional VPN** for internal resource access, and dependence on **password-based authentication**. These challenges have resulted in increased **security risks**, limited visibility into **user access**, and inefficient operational processes.

To solve this, Contoso plans to adopt **Microsoft Entra** to modernize its **identity and access management** by implementing **Identity Governance** for automated lifecycle management, enforcing **Conditional Access policies** for secure access control, and enabling centralized visibility through **monitoring** and **access reviews**.

To achieve this, you will configure **dynamic groups** and **lifecycle workflows**, deploy **Global Secure Access** to provide secure connectivity to **private** and **internet resources** without VPN, apply **Conditional Access policies** for enhanced security, and implement **Verified ID** to enable **passwordless identity verification** using **decentralized digital credentials**.

## Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will explore **Modern identity governance**, **secure access management**, and **decentralized identity solutions** using **Microsoft Entra**. You will configure **Identity Governance** features, implement secure access to **private** and **internet resources** with **Global Secure Access**, and enable **passwordless identity verification** using **Verified ID**.

Throughout the lab, you will work with **Microsoft Entra services** to manage **users and groups**, configure **Conditional Access policies**, automate **user lifecycle processes**, review **access activity**, and issue and verify **verifiable credentials**.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how **Microsoft Entra** helps organizations strengthen **security**, simplify **identity management**, and support **Zero Trust access** across **cloud** and **hybrid environments**.

## Objective

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- **Configure Identity Governance:** Implement Identity Governance features to manage access lifecycle, automate approvals, and enforce least-privilege access.
- **Manage Users and Groups:** Create and manage users, groups, and dynamic memberships using Microsoft Entra.
- **Automate Lifecycle Workflows:** Configure Lifecycle Workflows to automate onboarding, offboarding, and user access processes.
- **Implement Conditional Access and MFA:** Configure Conditional Access policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to strengthen identity security.
- **Deploy Global Secure Access:** Configure Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access to securely connect users to private and internet resources without traditional VPN dependency.
- **Monitor and Review Access Activities:** Perform access reviews and monitor identity-related activities for improved visibility and governance.
- **Configure Microsoft Entra Verified ID:** Set up Verified ID to enable decentralized and passwordless identity verification.
- **Issue and Verify Verifiable Credentials:** Use Microsoft Authenticator to issue and verify verifiable credentials securely.
- **Understand Zero Trust Security:** Explore how Microsoft Entra services work together to support Zero Trust identity and access management across cloud and hybrid environments.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have:
- Basic understanding of cloud and identity concepts.
- Familiarity with the Azure portal and Microsoft Entra admin center.
- Basic knowledge of authentication, authorization, and MFA concepts.
- Understanding of users, groups, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Basic understanding of networking concepts such as private and internet access.
- General awareness of Zero Trust security principles.

## Architecture

The Modern Identity Governance & Secure Access architecture uses **Microsoft Entra** to provide centralized identity management, secure access control, and decentralized identity verification across cloud and hybrid environments.

**Microsoft Entra ID** manages identities, governance policies, and access controls using features such as **Lifecycle Workflows, Access Reviews, and Conditional Access**. Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access enables secure access to private and internet resources without traditional VPN solutions. **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** provides passwordless identity verification using verifiable credentials and Microsoft Authenticator.

Built-in **Monitoring** and **Auditing** capabilities help organizations track sign-in activity, access events, and governance operations across the environment.
