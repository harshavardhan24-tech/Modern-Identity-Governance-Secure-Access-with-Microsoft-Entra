# Modern Identity Governance & Secure Access with Microsoft Entra

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will explore modern identity governance, secure access management, and decentralized identity solutions using Microsoft Entra. You will configure Identity Governance features, implement secure access to private and internet resources with Global Secure Access, and enable passwordless identity verification using Verified ID.

Throughout the lab, you will work with Microsoft Entra services to manage users and groups, configure Conditional Access policies, automate user lifecycle processes, review access activity, and issue and verify verifiable credentials.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how Microsoft Entra helps organizations strengthen security, simplify identity management, and support Zero Trust access across cloud and hybrid environments.

## Objective

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand Identity Governance and Zero Trust security concepts
- Manage users, groups, and access policies using Microsoft Entra
- Automate onboarding and offboarding with Lifecycle Workflows
- Implement Conditional Access and MFA policies
- Configure Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access for private and internet resources
- Monitor and review identity-related activities and access events
- Configure Microsoft Entra Verified ID
- Issue and verify verifiable credentials using Microsoft Authenticator
- Understand how Microsoft Entra services work together to provide secure identity and access management

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have:
- Basic understanding of cloud and identity concepts
- Familiarity with the Azure portal and Microsoft Entra admin center
- Basic knowledge of authentication, authorization, and MFA concepts
- Understanding of users, groups, and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts such as private and internet access
- General awareness of Zero Trust security principles

## Architecture

The Modern Identity Governance & Secure Access architecture uses **Microsoft Entra** to provide centralized identity management, secure access control, and decentralized identity verification across cloud and hybrid environments.

**Microsoft Entra ID** manages identities, governance policies, and access controls using features such as **Lifecycle Workflows, Access Reviews, and Conditional Access**. Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access enables secure access to private and internet resources without traditional VPN solutions. **Microsoft Entra Verified ID** provides passwordless identity verification using verifiable credentials and Microsoft Authenticator.

Built-in **Monitoring** and **Auditing** capabilities help organizations track sign-in activity, access events, and governance operations across the environment.
